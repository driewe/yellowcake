My name is Rebecca and I started the Experiential Gardener channel to share practical how-to Texas gardening information and tips that I have found to be useful based on my experience gardening in North Central Texas Zone 8a over the last forty plus years. <a href="https://itstimetexas.org/dads-tips-for-gardening-in-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gardening in Texas</a> is not difficult; it is just different. Much of the gardening information on seed packets and gardening publications/sites is written for milder climates and may not work well here. "Full sun" in Maine is very different from full sun in Texas. <a href="http://texasgardenclubs.org/lone-star-gardener/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gardeners in the Lone Star State</a> need gardening information that works here, in Texas.

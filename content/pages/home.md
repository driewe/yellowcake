      Growing your own vegetables is both fun and rewarding. All you really need
      to get started is some decent soil and a few plants. But to be a really
      successful vegetable gardener — and to do it organically — you'll need to
      understand what it takes to keep your plants healthy and vigorous. Here
      are the basics.

      Designing an herb garden is an exercise in instant gratification; many
      herbs are fast-growing plants to harvest (or at least snip) within weeks
      of germination. Keep reading for tips on how to create our favorite types
      of herb gardens—and read on for a list of our favorite must-grow herbs
      from our Edibles 101 plant guide.

    content: >-
      No matter what your level of experience, you can have blooming beauty in
      your life. But for your flowers to do best, it helps to understand a few
      basics about how flowers work and what they need.
  - title: Growing Fruit
    content: >-
      When growing fruit trees, though, it is important to know that some fruit
      trees require a pollinator, meaning a second tree of the same kind.
      Apples, pears, plums and tangerines require pollinators, so you will need
      the space to grow two trees. Also, fruit trees grow best in locations with
      well-draining, loamy soil. Most cannot tolerate heavy, poorly draining
      clay soil.

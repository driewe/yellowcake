My name is Rebecca and I started the Experiential Gardener channel to share practical how-to Texas gardening information and tips that I have found to be useful based on my experience gardening in North Central Texas Zone 8a over the last forty plus years. <a href="https://itstimetexas.org/dads-tips-for-gardening-in-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gardening in Texas</a> is not difficult; it is just different. Much of the gardening information on seed packets and gardening publications/sites is written for milder climates and may not work well here. "Full sun" in Maine is very different from full sun in Texas. <a href="http://texasgardenclubs.org/lone-star-gardener/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gardeners in the Lone Star State</a> need gardening information that works here, in Texas.

We planted traditional long rows and had access to a tractor to plow between them. My father and I 
hoed between the individual plants to keep out weeds. During dry summers we would also lay and move 
irrigation pipes to bring water to the plants from the nearby pond. I made extra money hoeing and made 
Christmas money thrashing/picking/selling pecans. We also picked wild crops such as Mustang grapes, 
wild plums, mulberries. We would always have a lot of produce from a garden this size (despite the deer) 
and so we would store all root crops in our root cellar on the hill behind the house and we had a second 
freezer and my mother would can beets and make jellies. My father would also periodically load the 
back of his pickup with watermelons and cantaloupes and drive to town and give them away. ​

<br />

Ann, was the wife of a second generation Irish family who was a wealth of gardening knowledge. She 
owned a green house full of exotic flowers that I had never seen before and every issue of National 
Geographic. I would read National Geographic, gardening books, seed catalogs and dream of seeing 
some of the places I read about and the countries where the exotic flowers grew naturally. Ann also had 
a cold frame, a cistern, and kept bees, doves, quail, chickens and guineas. ​

<br />

In the fall she would have me gather seeds from all the heirloom plants she grew and then we would 
plant flower, tomato and pepper seeds in December and January for our spring transplants. Ann never 
went to a store to buy flowers or any other plants. Besides, back then we only had a feed store that had 
a few tomato and pepper transplants in the town anyway. ​

<br />

When I was in my early teens, I began to order seeds from seed catalogs and experiment with different 
varieties. I began to grow specific varieties of tomatoes for my father that performed well in our climate.​

<br />

When I went to college, I moved to an urban environment with average size yards. At first I was very 
distraught about the lack of large available gardening space that I had when I lived in a rural area. Then I 
began to learn how to garden in smaller spaces in an urban environment and still get large yields without 
all the extra row spaces to maintain between the plants. I became an organic urban gardener and have 
been gardening in this type of environment since 1990.

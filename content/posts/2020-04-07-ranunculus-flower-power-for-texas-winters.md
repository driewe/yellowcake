Ranunculus Asiaticus or Persian Buttercups can brighten a Texas winter like no other flower! That is because ranunculus produces prolific 3” to 4” ethereal blossoms borne on 12” to 18” stems in show-stopping pink, red, rose, orange, white, and yellow. They look too delicate and special to grow over the winter. But don’t let appearances fool you. These flowers are durable and flower repeatedly beginning in late January through March. They also grow well in containers and make great long-lasting cut flowers.

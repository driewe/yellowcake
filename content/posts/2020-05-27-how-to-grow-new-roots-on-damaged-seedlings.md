If you find a damaged seedling that has been separated from its roots by a cutworm, slug, hail, animals or other damage, chances are high that you can save it and grow a new set of roots!

### Re-rooting or Growing a New Set of Roots: 

As soon as you find the damaged plant give it a second chance at life by trying this simple gardening tip. Just place the plant in a clear glass of tap water and set it in a location that receives bright, indirect light. It does not matter how wilted the plant may be. Put it in water as soon as possible. It will probably perk up in a few hours. 

Change out the water if it becomes cloudy or darkens. Fresh water and bright light are the keys to growing a new set of roots. Most plants will grow a new set of roots in 1 to 2 weeks.

### Replant the Plant in the Garden: 

Once the plant has regrown a new root system, it can be replanted in the garden or a pot. It is best to transplant the newly rooted plant in the evening when temperatures are cooler. After transplanting, water the plant with the water it was rooting in and give it a little additional water (water well).

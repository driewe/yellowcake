    Birds like tomatoes as much as we do. There are different methods that you
    can use to outsmart the birds so that you get to enjoy your tomato crop
    instead of losing it to the birds. Three methods are discussed in this blog
    and more detail is given in the video below.

### Method 1:
<br>
The first method involves the use of bird netting. Bird netting is available at nurseries and home and garden stores. It is very economical and comes in a variety of sizes.
<br><br>
Gently drape the center of the netting over the top of the tomato plants and tuck in the ends of the netting around the base of the plants.

### Method 2:

The second method involves the use of cd's connected with yarn to rings that slide back and forth along a wire. The cd's blow in the wind and as they turn they reflect blinding flashes of light from the sun. To connect the cd's to the wire, I used jewelry slip rings (available at hobby stores). You can use any rings you have, including shower rings. This allows the cd's to be moved wherever and whenever you need. I hung some cd's on shorter strands of yarn so that they dangle over the top of the plant and other cd's are on longer strands of yarn so that they hang near the center of the plant. These places are the most strategic places where ripening tomatoes will be located. *If the wind is really high, you might want to put clips or just a piece of tape on either side of a ring to keep the cd's from being moved and bunched together along the wire.

### Method 3:

<br>
The third method is to pick the tomatoes while they are**light orange**in color and then ripen them on your windowsill inside the house. This method allows you to pick the tomatoes before they turn red (ripen). Once the tomatoes become red and ripe is when the birds become interested in eating them.
